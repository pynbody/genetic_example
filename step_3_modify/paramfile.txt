#### Now, here's the new stuff:

# Load the IDs of the z=0 zoomed halo, and tell genetIC not to allow their
# mean overdensity to change:

id_file halo_z0_particles.txt
modify overdensity relative 1.0

# Load the IDs of the z=5, and tell genetIC to increase the mean overdensity
# by 20%:

id_file progenitor_z5_particles.txt
modify overdensity relative 1.2

# How much to increase by? Why 20% in the above? In the end, it takes some
# experimentation, but 20% changes are often quite significant. Other than
# re-running the simulation, a guide is to look at the delta chi^2 that
# genetic reports (in this case, around 5). Numbers that are much bigger than
# 1 indicate you have generated a rare field configuration. But the interpretation
# is not as simple as a likelihood going as exp(-delta chi^2/2) ~= 0.1, which would
# naively suggest the new object is 10x less common than the original. It would
# be great if we could rely on that, but there are also Jacobian and degeneracy
# factors to consider, which can be enormous. Delta chi^2 is really just a guide as to
# "how big a modification is this", without having a strict statistical significance.
