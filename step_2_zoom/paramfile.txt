# Seed the field using the default algorithm (parallel Fourier space):
random_seed	8896131

# Specify output directory:
outname zoom
outdir	 ./

# Pick output format:
outformat gadget3

# Specify the base-level grid, 50 Mpc/h, 128 cells on a side:
base_grid 50.0 128

# Set gadget particle type 2, for the base grid so that we can set a different
# softening length for these particles in the gadget configuration. For other codes,
# this has no effect. When writing a tipsy file, the softening length is automatically
# determined in proportion to the square root of the particle mass.

# Open a zoom grid, 4 times smaller than the parent, with 512 cells on a side
# I.e. equivalent of 4*(512/128) = 16 times higher spatial resolution,
# 16^3 ~ 4e3 times better mass resolution
